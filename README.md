# EyewitnessKaliLinux-
In this project I used the tool "Eyewitness" in Kali Linux, this tool allows you to take screenshots of URLs and store them into a file afterwards. This tool can help with the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test but could also help the attacker steal credentials or other sensitive information.
